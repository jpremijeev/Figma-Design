# Figma-Design

This repository showcases my design and proposed improvements to the **"I am a Young Sustainability Champion (Senior)" course**, a program from the Young Scientist Badge (YSB) platform by Science Centre Singapore. These enhancements were developed during my internship at the Science Centre (mid-May to mid-September 2024).

## Project Overview

As part of my role, I evaluated the existing course content and suggested improvements to enhance user experience, engagement, and the overall educational journey. My work includes:

- UI/UX enhancements
- Design of interactive elements
- Improved layout and visual clarity
